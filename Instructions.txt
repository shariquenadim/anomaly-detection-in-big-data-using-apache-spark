
Instructions for Running Credit Card Fraud Detection Code

Thank you for reviewing my credit card fraud detection project. Below are the detailed steps to run the code successfully on Kaggle, Google Colab, or in a local Jupyter Notebook environment.

Folder Structure:
```
PN-4_201CS156/
|-- Programs/
|   |-- Credit Card Fraud Detection (Big data analysis).ipynb
|-- Output Images/
|   |-- [All Output Images]
|-- Instructions.txt
```

Running the Code on Kaggle:

1. Visit Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/) and log in to your account.

2. Navigate to the "Kernels" section.

3. Click on the "New Kernel" button.

4. In the kernel editor, upload the Jupyter Notebook file `Credit Card Fraud Detection (Big data analysis).ipynb` from the `Programs` folder.

5. If the dataset is not automatically available, download the `creditcard.csv` file from Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data) and manually upload it to the kernel.

6. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to run the code.

7. The output images generated during the execution will be available in the `Output Images` folder.


Running the Code on Google Colab:

1. Visit Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in to your Google account.

2. Click on "File" in the top-left corner and select "Upload Notebook."

3. Upload the Jupyter Notebook file `Credit Card Fraud Detection (Big data analysis).ipynb` from the `Programs` folder.

4. If the dataset is not automatically available, download the `creditcard.csv` file from Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data) and manually upload it to Google Colab.

5. Execute the notebook cells sequentially by clicking the play button next to each cell.

6. The output images generated during the execution will be available in the `Output Images` folder.


Running the Code in Jupyter Notebook Environment:


1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the `Submission` folder.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook using the command: `jupyter notebook`

4. In the Jupyter Notebook dashboard, open the `Credit Card Fraud Detection (Big data analysis).ipynb` file from the `Programs` folder.

5. Run the notebook cells sequentially by clicking the run button or using the keyboard shortcut Shift + Enter.

6. The output images generated during the execution will be available in the `Output Images` folder.
